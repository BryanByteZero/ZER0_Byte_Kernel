v0
Stock cm kernel
v0.1
LZO Compression
Add Intelliplug 3.9 (i will update to 4.0 soon as i can), AutoSMP and Alucard hotplugs (Thanks to @faux123 @mrg666 @olokos @zakee94 @Alucard24 and @gekkehenkie11)
Kexec hardboot patch
OC of CPU (1.6Ghz)
OC of GPU (600Mhz)
UC of GPU (100Mhz)
A few governors (Yankdemand, Yankactive,Smartmax,Lionheart,Impulse,DanceDance,Bioshock)
NEON in kernel mode
Misc crypt tweaks
EXT 2/3/4 Support
NTFS Support
Adreno idler enabled by default and others GPU Tweaks
Double tap to wake and swipe to wake + swipe to sleep
state notifier
All avaliable TCPs
Faux Sound Control

v0.1.1
Up to date with cm
Added KCAL
Added High performance mode
Added Low latency audio playback
Overclock Slimbus for better audio
Optimized ARM RWSEM algorithm
Added Intellithermal v2
Added some fixes to GCC 5x 6x and 7x
If i can fix the errors probably the next version will be built a optimized version of UBER or UBER 7.0 (alread at uber tc 5 optimized for a7)
24 bits playback support
Ram OC
Added simple gpu algorithm
Silencied some logs
Added DOLBY_DAP dependency fix
Add SIO/VR/ZEN
Dynamic fsync
Enabled additional Moto G Exclusive audio channels TPA-a6165
F2FS support (only data)
Quadrooter fixed
To fully use new audio patchs use the lastest Kernel Adiutor

Bugs:yankactive

v0.1.2
Some fixes to the source and updated to the upstream 3.4.100 (i still need to update to the latest one which is 3.4.112)
Enabled optmization flags (O3, GRAPHITE and others)
Filesystem tweaks and powersuspend implemented
Dynamic management of dirty page writebacks, expire and cache pressure

v0.1.3
drivers: usb: Use Android device as USB keyboard/mouse
 Start ADB Debugging
* Start app
* Connect device to system via USB cable
 Base project: https://github.com/pelya/android-keyboard-gadget
Required app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=remote.hid.keyboard.client
block: scheduler: Added tripndroid scheduler
stereo call recording support
Reclaim RAM from loggers
Added one more freq to gpu oc
Rebased the OC and add UC (now the min is 96Mhz) 
Added undervolt (users cant control it yet)
smartmax updated
Trying to add zzmove
Introduce new flag WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT for power oriented
cpufreq: Add IntelliActive/Demand Govs
Trying to add oc of 1.8ghz
Still a wip oc of 1.8ghz yankactive zzmove userspace control voltage
Some other patchs
